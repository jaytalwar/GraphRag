## Board Member Approval Process

### Overview
The SACCOS policy requires a structured approval process involving board members to ensure proper governance and compliance. The policy moves through different stages: RESUBMITTED → IN PROGRESS → APPROVED, with each stage requiring specific actions from designated board members.

### Approval Workflow Status
The policy approval status is visually represented in the system through a progress indicator showing three main stages:
1. RESUBMITTED - Initial submission for review
2. IN PROGRESS - Under board member review
3. APPROVED - Successfully approved by all required board members

### Board Member Selection
1. During policy creation/update, the system requires selection of board members for approval
2. Board members are selected from a dropdown list of authorized approvers
