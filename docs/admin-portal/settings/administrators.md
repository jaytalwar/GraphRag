# Administrator Management

The Administrator Management section allows SACCOs to manage their system administrators by creating, inviting, and managing different administrator users with various roles.

## Accessing Administrator Management

1. Navigate to the Settings menu in the left sidebar
2. Click on "Administrators" under the Settings section

## Administrator List View

The main administrator page displays a list of all administrators with the following information:
- Full Name
- Email Address
- Phone Number
- Status (Active/Pending)
- Assigned Roles
- Actions

### Status Types
- **Active**: Administrator has accepted the invitation and has access to the system
- **Pending**: Administrator has been invited but hasn't yet accepted the invitation

## Managing Administrators

### Inviting New Administrators

To invite a new administrator:

1. Click the "Invite administrators" button in the top-right corner
2. Fill in the required information in the invite form:
   - Name*
   - Middle Name (optional)
   - Surname*
   - Email Address*
   - Country code*
   - Phone Number*
3. Click "Next" to proceed to role assignment
4. Select the appropriate roles for the administrator
5. Click "Save" to send the invitation

### Available Actions

For each administrator, the following actions are available:

1. **Edit** (Pencil icon): Modify administrator details and roles
2. **Delete** (Trash icon): Remove administrator access
3. **Reinvite** (Orange button): Resend invitation to pending administrators
4. **Unblock**: Restore access for blocked administrators

### Administrator Roles

Administrators can be assigned multiple roles including:
- Client Manager
- Admin
- Loan Officer
- Board Member
- Board Member Representative
- Teller
- General Manager
- Accountant

### Search Functionality

Use the search bar at the top of the administrator list to quickly find specific administrators by:
- Name
- Email
- Phone number

### Branch Access

Administrators can be given access to:
- All branches
- Specific branches only

## Security Considerations

- Only administrators with appropriate permissions can manage other administrators
- Invitation links expire after a set period
- Failed login attempts may result in temporary account blocks
- All administrator actions are logged for audit purposes

## Best Practices

1. Regularly review administrator access and roles
2. Remove access for administrators who no longer need it
3. Use unique email addresses for each administrator
4. Ensure administrators have the minimum required roles for their duties
5. Monitor pending invitations and reinvite if necessary
