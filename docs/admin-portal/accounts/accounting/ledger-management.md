# Ledger Management

## Overview
Ledger Management provides a structured way to organize and track all financial transactions within your Chart of Accounts. Ledgers are organized under groups (such as Assets, Liabilities, Incomes, Expenses) and can be created, edited, or deleted as needed.

## Features
- View a hierarchical Chart of Accounts with expandable/collapsible groups and ledgers
- Add new ledgers under any group
- Edit or delete existing ledgers (with permissions)
- See opening and closing balances for each ledger
- Mark ledgers as Bank/Cash accounts or for Reconciliation
- Quick access to add, edit, or delete actions

## Configurations
- Define parent group for each ledger (e.g., Assets, Liabilities)
- Set ledger code, opening balance (Dr/Cr), and opening date
- Mark as Bank/Cash account or enable Reconciliation
- Assign category, maturity date, and notes for each ledger

## Use Cases
- Adding a new cash or bank ledger under Assets
- Editing a ledger to update its balance, code, or details
- Deleting a ledger that is no longer needed
- Marking a ledger for reconciliation or as a bank/cash account

## Examples
