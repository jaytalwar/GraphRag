# Companies

## Overview
The Companies tab in the Message Service module allows administrators to manage messaging settings for each company, including SMS/Email enablement, credits, and sender associations.

## Automatic Company Creation
Companies are automatically created in the Message Service module whenever a new company is registered in the main CAMS system. This auto-provisioning ensures that messaging settings can be managed for every company without manual setup. As soon as a company is added to the main platform, it will appear in the Companies tab, ready for configuration of SMS, Email, credits, and sender associations.

> **Note:** No manual action is required to add a company to the Message Service. All companies are kept in sync with the main system.
