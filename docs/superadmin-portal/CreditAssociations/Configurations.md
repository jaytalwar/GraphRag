# Configurations Tab 

## ‚ú® Overview

**Purpose:**  
The Configurations tab empowers superadmins to tailor system-level and operational settings for each Credit Association (Sacco). This feature ensures that each Sacco can align its communication and approval workflows with its unique operational, compliance, and security requirements.

**Scope:**  
This tab is accessible to superadmins managing Credit Associations. It covers configuration of communication channels (Email/SMS) for notifications and the setup of maker-checker (dual control) approval flows for sensitive operations.

## üß© Feature Details

The Configurations tab is divided into two main sections:
- **Communication Permissions:** Manage how notifications (invites and transactions) are sent to members and administrators via Email and/or SMS.
- **Maker Checker Permissions:** Define which critical operations require a dual-approval workflow, enhancing security and compliance.

## üìê Functional Description

**Communication Permissions:**  
- **Invite Email:** Sends email invitations to new members/users when added to the Sacco.
- **Transaction Email:** Sends email notifications for financial transactions (deposits, withdrawals, loan disbursements).
- **Invite SMS:** Sends SMS invitations to new members/users.
- **Transaction SMS:** Sends SMS notifications for financial transactions.

**Maker Checker Permissions:**  
Enables approval workflows for the following operations:
- Request Loan Interest WaiveOff
- Back Dated Transaction Approval Request
- Request Member Bank
- Request Member MNO
- Request Teller Disbursed
- Request Teller Repayment
- Request Member Detail
- Request Teller Deposit
- Request Teller Ledger Entry
- Request Teller Withdraw

When enabled, these actions require a second user (checker) to approve the request initiated by the first user (maker).

- Maker-checker can be enabled for any combination of supported operations, but enabling too many may slow down operational workflows.
- Changes take effect immediately after saving.
- Disabling all communication channels may result in members not receiving important updates.
