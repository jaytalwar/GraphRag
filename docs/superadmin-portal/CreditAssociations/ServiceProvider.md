# Service Provider Tab

### ‚ú® Overview

**Purpose:**  
The Service Provider tab enables superadmins to view, manage, and configure external service providers (such as insurance companies) linked to a specific Credit Association (Sacco or MFI). This feature is introduced to streamline the integration and management of third-party services, ensuring that Credit Associations can easily enable or disable services like loan insurance for their members.

**Scope:**  
This documentation covers the Service Provider tab's interface and functionality, focusing on the integration with insurance providers (e.g., Sanlam Insurance), and the enable/disable workflow for these services.
